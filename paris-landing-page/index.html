            <h2>Eiffel Tower</h2>
            <p>
              The plan to build a tower 300 metres high was conceived as part of
              preparations for the World's Fair of 1889. Bolting the joint of
              two crossbowmen collection Tour Eiffel.
            </p>

            <p>
              The wager was to "study the possibility of erecting an iron tower
              on the Champ-de-Mars with a square base, 125 metres across and 300
              metres tall". Selected from among 107 projects, it was that of
              Gustave Eiffel, an entrepreneur, Maurice Koechlin and Emile
              Nouguier, both engineers, and Stephen Sauvestre, an architect,
              that was accepted.
            </p>

            <p>
              Emile Nouguier and Maurice Koechlin, the two chief engineers in
              Eiffel's company, had the idea for a very tall tower in June 1884.
              It was to be designed like a large pylon with four columns of
              lattice work girders, separated at the base and coming together at
              the top, and joined to each other by more metal girders at regular
              intervals.
            </p>

            <p>
              The tower project was a bold extension of this principle up to a
              height of 300 metres - equivalent to the symbolic figure of 1000
              feet.
